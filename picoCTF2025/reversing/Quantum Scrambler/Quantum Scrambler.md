# Description

We invented a new cypher that uses "quantum entanglement" to encode the flag. Do you have what it takes to decode it?Connect to the program with netcat:`$ nc verbal-sleep.picoctf.net 52453`The program's source code can be downloadedÂ [here](https://challenge-files.picoctf.net/c_verbal_sleep/9ff389c89cc804572242d1e2adfeb6bf6a9f1c03cb94c65b30a27f272e24a63d/quantum_scrambler.py).

# Solution

The python code generated what it seemed garbage at first ...

After testing it locally  it seems there is logic to this madness, at the end the python script is packing a bunch of stuff between the Nth and Nth+1 chars, with this insight it's just a matter of programmatically recover what we are interested in ...

```python
def unscramble(L):
A = L
print(len(A))
s = ""
for i in (A):
first, last = i[0], i[-1]
#print(first)
try:
value = int(first, 16)
if((value > 0x20) & ( value < 0x7f)):
#print(chr(value))
s+=chr(value)
except:
print("first", first[0])
try:
value = int(last, 16)
if((value > 0x20) & ( value < 0x7f)):
#print(chr(value))
s+=chr(value)
except:
print("last",last[-1])
print(s)
```

A bit buggy but we can recover the flag ...
